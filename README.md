OTHACKS
=======

Quick and dirty command line scripts for [Octatrack](http://www.elektron.se/products/octatrack) sample management. Just for my personal use, no documentation (read the code) and support. Feel free to fork and create a polished product.

WARNING: These scripts change (undocumented) Octatrack files and might destroy your work. Read and understand the code, backup and use with care.
